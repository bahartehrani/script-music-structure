# Currently: 
# Map each song's color per segment
# If colors are nearby, then embeddings are nearby
# Using transformers
# Explain the path extraction as bullet point steps - for report
# Go from path to coloring - explain as well
# Brainstorm target once we have iterations of ML algo
# Whether it makes it to top 100 
# Individual drops versus collabs
# Differences in structures from Tiktok versus radio virality
# Move to server

# Current step:
# Follow the functions deepest down, and test upwards.
# Complete find_mute_decomposition - 
# Structure and PathExtraction functions to be filled in.
